# Media Happi: Coding Standards Document

At Media Happi, we believe in maintaining a high standard of code to ensure our projects are efficient, maintainable, and clear. The following guidelines have been set to ensure consistency across our projects and to make the codebase easier to navigate for all team members.

## 1. Naming Conventions:
- **Variables**: Use `camelCase` for variable names.
  - Example: `userProfile`, `itemList`.
- **Classes & Objects**: Use `PascalCase`.
  - Example: `UserProfile`, `ItemController`.
- **Functions & Methods**: Use `camelCase`.
  - Example: `getUserData()`, `setProfileImage()`.
- **Constants**: Use `UPPER_CASE` with underscores.
  - Example: `MAX_USERS`, `API_ENDPOINT`.

## 2. Indentation & Spacing:
- Use 4 spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs.
- Always use spaces around operators and after commas.
  - Example: `var x = y + z;`
- Place a space after the `//` in single-line comments.
  - Example: `// This is a comment.`

## 3. Commenting:
- Commenting should be used generously throughout the code to describe the logic, especially for complex code blocks.
- Use `//` for single-line comments.
- Use `/* ... */` for multi-line comments.
- Always comment on major sections of your code, even if it seems obvious.

## 4. Functions & Methods:
- Functions should be concise and perform a single task.
- Function names should be verbs if the function changes the state of the program and nouns if they're used to return a certain value.
- Do not use global variables unless absolutely necessary.
- Avoid long parameter lists.

## 5. Bracing Style:
- Use the 1TBS (One True Brace Style).
  ```javascript
  if (condition) {
      // code here
  } else {
      // code here
  }

## 6. Error Handling:

Always validate and sanitize user inputs.
Use try/catch blocks for sections of the code where errors are expected.
Always have a generic error handler for uncaught exceptions.

## 7. Variables:

Declare variables at the top of their scope.
Avoid using global variables. Instead, opt for function parameters or class properties.

## 8. File Organization:

Group related code into folders.
Name the files meaningfully, reflecting the primary functionality or class they contain.
Ensure that each file has a single responsibility.

## 9. Code Reuse:

Avoid duplicating code. Instead, abstract it into functions or classes.
If a piece of code is used in multiple places, consider making it a utility function.

## 10. Dependencies:

Always keep your dependencies up-to-date.
Do not import unnecessary libraries or modules.

## Conclusion:

Maintaining coding standards is a collective responsibility. While this document provides a guideline, it's essential to use common sense and discuss with the team when unsure. A clean, consistent codebase is not just a reflection of quality work; it's a testament to team collaboration.
